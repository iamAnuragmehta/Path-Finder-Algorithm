# Path Finder Algorithm

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project visualizes two popular graph algorithms, **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**, to find the shortest paths in weighted graphs. Built with **React.js**, this interactive tool is designed for students, developers, and enthusiasts to understand the inner workings of these algorithms through dynamic visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Features

- **Interactive Graph Building**:
  - Add and connect nodes to form custom graphs.
  - Assign positive or negative weights to edges dynamically.
- **Algorithm Selection**:
  - Choose between **Dijkstra's** and **Bellman-Ford** algorithms for visualization.
- **Visualization**:
  - Step-by-step animations of the pathfinding process.
  - Real-time updates to the graph as paths are calculated.
- **Responsive UI**:
  - Accessible on devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobiles.

## ðŸ“ˆ Algorithms Implemented

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Efficient for non-negative weighted graphs.
- **Limitation**: Cannot handle negative edge weights.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E \cdot \log V)\) with a priority queue.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

- Can handle graphs with negative edge weights.
- Detects negative weight cycles and alerts users.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V \cdot E)\).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended).
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager.

## ðŸ“Š Usage

1. **Create and Edit Graphs:**

   - Click on the canvas to add nodes.
   - Drag from one node to another to create edges.
   - Adjust edge weights directly through the UI.

2. **Choose Algorithm:**

   - Use the dropdown menu to select between **Dijkstra's** and **Bellman-Ford**.

3. **Run Visualization:**

   - Click "Run" to execute the algorithm step-by-step on the graph.

4. **Reset the Graph:**
   - Click the "Reset" button to clear the graph and start over.
